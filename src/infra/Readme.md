# Infrastructure Layer (`src/infra`)

The `infra` directory contains the **infrastructure layer** of the application. This layer is responsible for all low-level operations and external integrations, such as network communication, storage, and platform-specific utilities.

It serves as the **bridge between the application's core logic and the outside world**.

## 📁 Structure

The `infra` folder is divided into submodules, each representing a specific infrastructure concern.
