   * v2.5.6 Daniel Jim√©nez
   * Here we have two possibilities:
   * - if the parent exists it means that we have to mark this item as TRASHED because it's the
   * root of the delete event.
   * - if the parent doesn't exist it means that this item has been deleted because it's inside
   * of a folder that has been deleted and we need to find that folder to mark it as TRASHED.
   *
   * Warning: Using just folderUuid is not going to work. If we have the following structure:
   * /folder_and_subfolders/folder/file.txt
   * If we delete /folder_and_subfolders we are still going to be able to find the parentUuid of file.txt.
