   * root of the delete event.
   * - if the parent doesn't exist it means that this item has been deleted because it's inside
   * of a folder that has been deleted and we need to find that folder to mark it as TRASHED.
   *
   * Warning: Using just folderUuid is not going to work. There are some times in which we are
   * getting the parentUuid even when the parent folder is deleted.
